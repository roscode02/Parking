 MY SOLUTION FOR PARKING MANAGMENT MAINLY HANDLES THE SPACE ALLOCATION FOR DIFFERENT TYPE OF VEHICLE. 
IT WILL GIVE EXACT POSITION WHERE WE WILL HAVE TO PARK THE VEHICLE.


THERE ARE A TOTAL FOR THREE TYPES OF VEHICLES PERMITTED

1.) BIKE :- IT TAKES ONE SPACE TO PARK
2.) CAR  :- IT TAKES TWO SPACE TO PARK
3.) BUS  :- IT TAKES FOUR SPACE TO PARK

--> WHEN THE PROGRAM STARTS USER HAS TO ENTER THE NUMBER OF TOTAL AVIALABLE PARKING SPOTS;


--> A ARRAY TO THAT MANY SPOTS IS INITLIAZED AND IT ASSIGNED A VALUE OF ZERO

     
     > THEN WHEN A VEHICLE COMES TO PARK WE WILL FIRST SEARCH FOR AVIALABLE PARKING SPOTS 
       AND IF THE SPACE
       IS THERE IT WILL RETURN THE INDEX FOR THE FIRST SPACE FROM WHERE THE VEHICLE CAN PARK

     > TO SEARCH I HAVE USED A FOR LOOP WHICH LOOKS FOR A EMPTY SPACE THEN TRIES TO FIND CONSECUTIVE SPACE 
     AVIALIBITY ACCORDING TO TYPE OF VEHICLE . A VALUE OF 1 IS ASSIGNED TO ALL THE SPACE FOUND.

     > AT LAST WHEN VEHICLE IS REMOVED THEN THE ALLOCATED SPACE IS FREED A THE VALUE OF 0 IS ASSIGNED.
     
     > MAP IS USED TO STORE THE INDEX FROM WHERE THE VEHICLE IS PARKED



--> PROGRAM ALSO PRINTS THE TOTAL COST FOR PARKING AFTER TAKING INPUT INCOMING TIME AND OUTGOING TIME
    
    > RATE IS DEFINED AS 
           > RS 56 PER HOUR FOR CAR
           > RS 100 PER HOUR FOR BUS
           > RS 34 PER HOUR FOR BIKE
